# React + Vite.5.3.6

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

## use code

```bash
npm create vite@5.4 . -- --template react
```

```text
vite@5.4 => vite:^5.3.4 -> vite:5.4.21
         => vite:~5.3.4 -> vite:5.3.6
```

```bash
npm i
```

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

```bash
npm start
```

```bash
npm run dev
```
